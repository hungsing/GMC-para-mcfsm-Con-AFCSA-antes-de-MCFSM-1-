Distributed software resulting from emerging paradigms such as \emph{service-oriented computing} (SOC) and Cloud/Fog computing are transforming the world of software systems, giving impulse to what is called the API's economy. The underlying idea of the API's economy is that it is possible to construct software artifacts by composing services provided by third parties and previously registered in repositories. This envisages a generation of applications running over globally available computational resources and communication infrastructure, which, at run-time, are dynamically and transparently reconfigured by the intervention of a dedicated middleware with the capability to discover and bind a running application with a certain requirement, to a service capable of fulfilling it.

In general APIs only describe the data type of the arguments needed to invoke the service while the most important aspects of its behaviour are documented informally resulting in a major drawback in the possibility of achieving SOC's utopia: automatic brokering of services. In this quest, thus, a key element is the existence of formal languages, together with associated analysis techniques, capable of fully expressing the API behavioral contract.
The way in which these formalisms are defined prescribe that correctness of the communication (usually reduced to the absence of certain configurations\cite{lange:popl15}:
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
\item \emph{deadlock}: a participant is in a state in which it can only consume messages from participants whose corresponding message queues are empty,
\item \emph{unspecified reception}: a participant is in a state in which it can only consume messages from participants which are not in the corresponding message queues, and
\item \emph{orphan message}: all participants are in a state of no outgoing transition and there is a non-empty buffer.
\end{inparaenum}
) can only be asserted in the presence of all the participants involved. Thus, when they are used for formalising an inter operability check over a communication channel with more than two require points, all participants must commit to be bound even when they may not be required at the beginning of the communication.
\emph{Generalised Multi-party Compatibility} (GMC), defined in \cite{lange:popl15}, is a sufficient condition for the correctness condition detailed above
In this work we study:
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
 \item a new class of CFSMs, called \emph{Multichannel Communicating Finite State Machines -- mCFSMs}, with an explicit definition of the communication channels enabling, for a participant, the possibility of having more than one channel with the other participants
 \item a definition of the GMC property for systems of mCFSMs, 
 \item a class of \emph{Asynchronous Communicating Automatas -- ACAs} with the capability of internalising the communication as read / write operations on internal buffers, enabling partial composition of communicating automata, and
 \item a method for mapping an ACA to a mCFSM providing a checking mechanism of the GMC property for the class of ACA.
 \end{inparaenum}

% \newpage
% \noindent In a galaxy far, far away, a psychopathic emperor and his most trusted servant -- a former Jedi Knight known as Darth Vader -- are ruling a universe with fear. They have built a horrifying weapon known as the Death Star, a giant battle station capable of annihilating a world in less than a second. When the Death Star's master plans are captured by the fledgling Rebel Alliance, Vader starts a pursuit of the ship carrying them. A young dissident Senator, Leia Organa, is aboard the ship \& puts the plans into a maintenance robot named R2-D2. Although she is captured, the Death Star plans cannot be found, as R2 \& his companion, a tall robot named C-3PO, have escaped to the desert world of Tatooine below. Through a series of mishaps, the robots end up in the hands of a farm boy named Luke Skywalker, who lives with his Uncle Owen \& Aunt Beru. Owen \& Beru are viciously murdered by the Empire's stormtroopers who are trying to recover the plans, and Luke \& the robots meet with former Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi to try to return the plans to Leia Organa's home, Alderaan. After contracting a pilot named Han Solo \& his Wookiee companion Chewbacca, they escape an Imperial blockade. But when they reach Alderaan's coordinates, they find it destroyed - by the Death Star. They soon find themselves caught in a tractor beam \& pulled into the Death Star. Although they rescue Leia Organa from the Death Star after a series of narrow escapes, Kenobi becomes one with the Force after being killed by his former pupil - Darth Vader. They reach the Alliance's base on Yavin's fourth moon, but the Imperials are in hot pursuit with the Death Star, and plan to annihilate the Rebel base. The Rebels must quickly find a way to eliminate the Death Star before it destroys them as it did Alderaan (aprox. 200 palabras).
